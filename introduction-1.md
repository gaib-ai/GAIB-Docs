# Introduction

GAIB is the economic layer for AI and compute future. We enable anyone to own a piece of AI. The name “GAIB” draws inspiration not only from the movie Dune, symbolizing “the unseen” or “the future”, but also from our core pillars: GPU, AI, and Fi (Financialization). In the AI era, GPUs are the new assets, and compute is the new currency akin to spice in Dune, GAIB is liberating a trillion-dollar AI & compute market.

GAIB focuses on creating a new commodity asset class - GPUs, with yields backed by real AI cashflow. GAIB financializes and tokenizes enterprise-grade GPUs and creates a vibrant economy around it. GAIB addresses the growing demand for high-performance computing resources in the AI era by transforming how high-end GPUs are financed, traded, and utilized.

GAIB emerges from the recognition that the current landscape of high-performance computing, particularly within artificial intelligence, machine learning and the extended compute ecosystem, faces significant challenges in terms of resource allocation, financing, and accessibility. \
