## NFT

This section has two features called "Mint" and "Stake" respectively. We will explain these concepts to give an overview on how they are applied in the GAIB platform.&#x20;

### What is NFT minting?

NFT minting is the process of creating a non-fungible, or unique, token on a blockchain. The ERC-721 token standard on Ethereum for non-fungible token (NFT) was launched in 2018. Since then, NFT's have become a popular segment of the blockchain industry. Because NFTs are based on public, permissionless blockchains, NFT minting isn’t limited exclusively to the established select few – in principle, anyone can mint NFTs for a wide array of use cases. And in our use case, we use NFT's to contral access to industry-grade GPU computing power.

### What is NFT staking?

NFT staking is the process where NFT owners may receive compensation by locking their digital assets on a particular platform or protocol. The compensation received from such NFT staking can vary depending on the platform and the type of NFT. In our use case, NFT staking creates opportunities to earn rewards from the tokenizing of GPU access, and to diversify one's crypto portfolio — but staking per se can be risky.&#x20;

## Tenant

Simply put the tenancy concept used on the GAIB platform is for interested parties who would like to have access to GPU clusters to have a means to buy such access through GAIB NFT's, primarily for AI model training and inferencing. The user can also handle billing, instance management, as well as monitor nodes through our platform.&#x20;
