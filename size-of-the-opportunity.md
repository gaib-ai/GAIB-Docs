# Size of the Opportunity

GAIB stands at the nexus of three rapidly expanding markets—Artificial Intelligence (AI), Real-World Assets (RWAs), and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)—each projected to grow into the trillions.&#x20;

Global spending on GPU cloud computing alone may reach an estimated **$2 trillion** by 2027, while AI could boost global GDP by **$7 trillion** over the next decade. Tokenized RWAs are on track to surpass **$30 trillion** by 2034, and DeFi is expected to expand to **$450 billion** by 2030.

By bridging these ecosystems, GAIB positions itself as a key financial enabler in the emerging AI economy. The significance of this convergence is hard to overstate. AI and compute-related companies already claim trillions in combined market capitalization, and rising global investment in private credit further underscores the appetite for novel funding solutions. GAIB’s unified approach to tokenizing compute assets, securing real-world collateral, and leveraging DeFi mechanics uniquely addresses these combined market forces. As these sectors continue to merge, GAIB’s role as a core facilitator of capital and innovation stands to reshape the future of AI-driven finance.
