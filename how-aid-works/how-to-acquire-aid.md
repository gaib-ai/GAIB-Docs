# How to Acquire AID

## **Minting**

Whitelisted, KYC-compliant users can mint _AID_ directly on the GAIB protocol by depositing stablecoins (e.g. USDC).

## **Swapping**

Through the GAIB & partnered websites, non-whitelisted users can exchange stablecoins for _AID_ by accessing external liquidity pools.
