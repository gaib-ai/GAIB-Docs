# How AID works

AID is the first **AI Synthetic Dollar** introduced by GAIB, fully backed by GPU financing deals and a reserve of treasury bills. Its supply adjusts in real-time—when capital enters the protocol or yield is generated, one AID is minted; when yield is paid out, one _AID_ is burned, ensuring its market cap reflects the value of the underlying assets.

Whitelisted, KYC-compliant users can mint AID by depositing USDC, while non-whitelisted users can swap stablecoins for _AID_ through liquidity pools. Once acquired, _AID_ can be staked to earn **sAID**, a token that accrues yield as the protocol collects real world yields. AID can also be traded, used for lending or borrowing, or provided as liquidity in AMM pools for additional returns.

When staked, AID is exchanged for **sAID**, and its value increases over time based on the protocol’s rewards. Users can unstake after a 14-day cooldown period and receive their original stake plus accrued rewards.

In addition to staking, **sAID** can be used for trading in AMM pools, liquidity provisioning, or creating Principal and Yield Tokens (PT/YT) for customizable risk-return strategies.

In terms of exiting _AID_, whitelisted users can redeem _AID_ for USDC at a 1:1 ratio, while non-whitelisted users can swap it for stablecoins via liquidity pools, expanding accessibility.

Overall, _AID_ bridges compute with on-chain assets, offering users a seamless way to earn yield, manage risk, and create strategies based on their own risk-reward preferences.&#x20;
