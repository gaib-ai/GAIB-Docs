# What Can You Do with AID

## **Staking**

Users can stake _AID_ to receive _**sAID**_, a liquid, yield-bearing token representing their staked positions. Yield accrues via a floating exchange rate between _sAID_ and _AID_, allowing stakers to benefit from the growth in the underlying asset.

## **Lending and Borrowing**

GAIB will integrate with major lending protocols to let users deposit _AID_ into lending pools and earn additional returns. Borrowing will also be possible, enabling users to lock major cryptocurrencies as collateral and borrow _AID_ against them.

## **Trading**

A variety of trading pairs will be introduced, pairing _AID_ with other major currencies. By positioning _AID_ as a base currency, GAIB aims to facilitate seamless swaps and easy management of trading positions.

## **Liquidity Provisioning**

GAIB incentivizes users to supply _AID_ liquidity in AMM pools. Liquidity providers earn fees and receive GAIB token incentives, making this an attractive way to support the ecosystem and generate income.
