# Risk Management & Enhancements

## **Overcollateralization**

If the distinct pool of assets in the SPC contains varying GPU-backed loans at face value of $100,000,000 and the amount of tokenized GPU tokens purchased by Investors is $75,000,000, then $25,000,000 of distinct assets are left to still satisfy the existing $75,000,000 purchased by investors representing a \~33% overcollateralization.

## **Cash Reserves**

Specific amount of capital set aside left to service interest and debt repayment. Continuing the previous example, if the initial $75,000,000 has a side-pocket for $5,000,000 in cash reserves this represents a \~6.6% reserve. The $5,000,000 would be funded by the proceeds of the debt purchase, so $70,000,000 would be sent to the underwriter with the remaining $5,000,000 to an account not accessible by the SP nor the Underwriter.

## **Credit Insurance**

GAIB can set out to get insurance on the debt instrument itself. There are multiple regulated firms that can offer this insurance normally paying a fixed percentage in the event of a default. Thus, transferring risk of nonpayment from the GPU Provider to a well-regarded insurance provider with a large balance sheet.
