# Tokenization Criteria & Process

## Tokenizing Criteria&#x20;

1. Asset pool must have perfected security interests.
2. Participation agreements must:
   * Require monthly surveillance reporting.
   * Have defined delinquency thresholds.
   * Ensure overcollateralization compliance.
3. Underwriters must:
   * Have at least 2 years of origination history.
   * Provide sufficient data for monitoring.

## Tokenization Process

1. GAIB will create a tokenization engine that will tokenize the SPC (tokenized GPU tokens) which represents the legal and economic claims to the underlying cashflows generated through the bundled GPU Provider loans in the SPC.
2. GAIB will enter into Asset Tokenization Agreements with the SPC.
3. Investors send capital in the form of a stablecoin to the GAIB Smart Contract in return they will be given tokens (tokenized GPUs) representing ownership in the GAIB SPC Loans.
4. Cashflows from the SPC are sent to the GAIB DeFi Vault, increasing the value of Investors' tokenized GPU tokens held.
5. Investors can withdraw funds from the Vault by burning their tokenized GPU tokens and receiving their share of stablecoins that are available for redemption at the current conversion rate from tokenized GPU tokens back into stablecoin.

#### **GAIB Tokenization Engine**

The GAIB Smart Contract which will automatically transact Investor capital and send back a proportionate amount of tokenized GPUs to the Investor’s wallet. The smart contract will act similar to a Private Placement Memorandum and Subscription Agreement with the returned tokenized GPU tokens acting as economic rights and represent the share in the SPC’s future cashflows.

#### **GAIB DeFi Vault**

Is the pool of yield rewards earned by the SPC through its segregated portfolio of deals between (SPs ->Underwriters->GPU Providers). Investors can withdraw their rewards by burning their tokenized GPU tokens at the current conversion rate into stablecoin based on the GPU Pool’s value and on assets available for redemption (completed loan deals). The value of the Vault will increase over time as SPC cashflows are sent back.
