# Importance to the Market

As AI continues to advance, the hunger for computing power has soared—yet traditional financing often falls short, especially for data centers that lack the resources of major cloud providers. GAIB responds by tokenizing GPUs and their cash flows, enabling data centers to secure capital in a more flexible, transparent way. At the same time, investors gain direct access to a rapidly growing asset class, capturing the value of high-demand GPUs without having to purchase hardware or bet solely on semiconductor stocks.&#x20;

## Why GAIB Matters to Cloud / Data Centers

### **Faster and More Flexible Funding**

Data centers face intense pressure to acquire high-performance GPUs and expand infrastruture to scale faster and meet soaring demand. GAIB’s platform removes many of the obstacles tied to conventional financing—lengthy approval processes, high interest rates, and rigid terms—by transforming GPU loans or cash flows into tradable ERC-20 tokens. This streamlined approach provides swift access to capital, allowing data centers to quickly respond to surging market demand.

### **Lower Costs and Greater Stability**

Unlike traditional bank loans or private lending, GAIB’s tokenization model can reduce financing costs and diversify funding sources. By tapping into a global pool of investors, cloud / data centers gain more stability and resilience in a rapidly evolving AI economy.&#x20;

## Why GAIB Matters to Investors

### **Direct Exposure to AI Compute**

While big-name stocks are one way to profit from AI, they don’t always capture the true value of on-the-ground computing resources. GAIB offers investors a more targeted route by tokenizing enterprise-grade GPUs—such as NVIDIA’s H100 or H200—linking returns directly to GPU-centric revenue streams.

### **Yield-Bearing Base Currency**&#x20;

GAIB’s yield-bearing AI Synthetic Dollar, **USDai**, rewards holders with passive income simply by staking. Beyond that, it serves as a versatile base currency for trading, lending, and liquidity provisioning across major DeFi protocols, delivering robust functionality and utility for investor portfolios.

### **Flexible Financial Strategies**

From conservative hedging to higher-risk speculations, GAIB’s integrations with various DeFi protocols creates a range of derivatives and use cases for USDai. Whether investors are seeking stable, predictable yields or aiming to exploit market volatility, GAIB let them tailor their strategies, catering to a spectrum of risk-reward profiles.&#x20;

## Why GAIB Matters to the AI Economy

By establishing new financial infrastructure and primitives around compute, GAIB liberates the trillion dollar AI economy.&#x20;

The tokenization approach transforms previously illiquid GPU assets into tradable instruments, encouraging capital flows that fuel AI innovation and growth. Building liquid markets for tokenized GPU assets fosters efficient price discovery and invites more participants, leading to an AI economy flywheel.&#x20;

In the long run, GAIB builds a robust and scalable economic layer serving all participants in the AI economy through financial and technological innovations, eliminating capital bottlenecks as AI demands continue to scale, ensuring sustained AI development, while giving everyone equitable access to AI dividends.&#x20;
