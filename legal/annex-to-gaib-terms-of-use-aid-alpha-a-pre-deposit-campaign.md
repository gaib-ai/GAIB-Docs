# Annex to GAIB Terms of Use – AID Alpha, a Pre-Deposit Campaign

This Annex to the GAIB Terms of Use (“Annex”) governs your participation in the AID Alpha Campaign (“Campaign”), a pre-deposit initiative designed to facilitate the launch of the AID token ("AID"). By requesting, engaging with, or subscribing to the Campaign, you agree to be bound by this Annex, which supplements and is construed in conjunction with the GAIB Terms of Use, GAIB Disclaimers and Risk Disclosures, and GAIB Privacy Policy (collectively, "GAIB Agreements"), as amended from time to time. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Annex and the GAIB Agreements, this Annex shall prevail with respect to the Campaign.



Campaign Mechanics:

1. Deposit Process: Users shall deposit USDC and/or USDT (collectively, “Digital Assets”) into designated vaults on selected blockchain networks;
2. Receipt Tokens: Upon deposit, users shall receive a receipt token (“Receipt Token”) which shall serve as evidence of their participation in the Campaign and shall be redeemable for AID tokens upon the launch of AID;
3. Lock Up Period: Deposits of Digital Assets shall be irrevocably locked for the duration of the Campaign, and early withdrawal shall not be permitted;
4. Allocation: Funds received from Digital Asset deposits shall be initially allocated to U.S. Treasury Bills or other fund deals (“Fund Deals”) and subsequently may be allocated to GPU or other financing deals (“Financing Deals”). GAIB shall retain sole and absolute discretion with respect to the allocation of such funds and the selection of underlying transactions; and
5. Redemption Options: Holders of Receipt Tokens shall have the option, exercisable upon the launch of AID, to either (i) convert their Receipt Tokens into AID tokens on a one-click basis, or (ii) withdraw their initially deposited Digital Assets, forfeiting any accrued rewards or benefits associated with participation in the Campaign.



You hereby acknowledge and irrevocably agree that you shall not be permitted to withdraw your deposited Digital Assets from the Campaign prior to the completion of the launch of the AID token.

Additional Risk Disclosures:

1. Counterparty Risk: Risk of default by counterparties involved in Fund Deals and/or Financing Deals, which could result in a loss of principal or a reduction in anticipated yield. In particular, I understand and accept that such underlying deals may be issued by their respective product issuers and managed by the corresponding product managers, who are third parties to GAIB and over whom GAIB has no control.
2. Yield Flowback Delays: Delays in the flowback of yield from Fund Deals and/or Financing Deals due to unforeseen circumstances, such as operational challenges or regulatory hurdles, which could impact the timing of distributions to AID holders.
3. Market Volatility: The value of AID may be subject to significant market volatility, particularly in redemption models, due to fluctuations in demand, changes in market sentiment, or unforeseen events.
4. Regulatory Risk: The regulatory landscape governing digital assets and decentralized finance is evolving, and changes in regulations could adversely affect the value of AID or the viability of the Campaign.
5. Smart Contract Risk: The smart contracts underlying the Campaign and AID may be subject to vulnerabilities or bugs, which could result in a loss of funds.
6. Liquidity Risk: There may be limited liquidity for AID tokens.
7. Loss of Principal: Due to the inherent risks associated with the Campaign and AID, you may lose all or a substantial portion of your invested Digital Assets.
8. Allocation: GAIB retains ultimate discretion regarding the allocation of funds and underlying transactions, which may not align with your individual investment objectives.
9. Tax Risk: The tax treatment of Digital Assets and AID is uncertain and may vary depending on your jurisdiction. You should consult with a tax advisor regarding the tax implications of participating in the Campaign.

&#x20;
