You and GAIB agree that in the event of any and all disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, "Disputes") arising from or related to the use of the Platform and these Terms, either party will first contact the other party and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the Dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation, any court action, after first allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond. Both you and the GAIB agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration against you, or GAIB, as applicable.

You and GAIB agree that any Dispute shall be settled by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, by three arbitrators, appointed in accordance with the Rules, which are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The language of arbitration will be English. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you and GAIB are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.

FURTHER, YOU AND GAIB AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND IT MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS ACTION. IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS LIMITED, VOIDED, OR FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THEN, UNLESS THE PARTIES MUTUALLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE PARTIES' AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING SO LONG AS THE PROCEEDING IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION. IF A COURT DECIDES THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH ARE DEEMED INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION MUST BE BROUGHT IN A COURT OF PROPER JURISDICTION AND NOT IN ARBITRATION.

23\. Limitation on Time to File Claims.
