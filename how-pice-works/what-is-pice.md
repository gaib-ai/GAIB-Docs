# What is USDai

## **The First AI Synthetic Dollar**

GAIB introduces **USDai**, the first AI synthetic dollar, offering investors yields backed by real-world AI demand without sacrificing liquidity. Each USDai token is fully collateralized by a portfolio of GPU financing deals and a small reserve of treasury bills. When one dollar enters GAIB’s protocol or when the portfolio generates a dollar in yield, one PICE is minted; conversely, when a dollar of yield is paid out, one PICE is burned. This ensures PICE’s market capitalization mirrors its underlying assets, providing a robust intrinsic value.

## **An Avenue for Yield Generation**

Although USDai itself is not yield-bearing, investors can stake it to earn returns. For each PICE staked, investors receive one **sUSDai**, a liquid receipt token denoting their share of the staked position. As the portfolio generates income, sUSDai accrues the corresponding yield.

## **A Base Currency for the AI Era**

Beyond simply representing an investor’s share in the portfolio, USDai is poised to become a foundational currency in the AI economy. GAIB plans to integrate PICE across various DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, trading, and liquidity provisioning, further enhancing its long-term value beyond native yield generation.
