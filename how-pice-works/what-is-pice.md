# What is USDai

## **The First AI Synthetic Dollar**

GAIB introduces _**USDai**_, the first AI synthetic dollar, offering investors yields backed by real-world AI demand without sacrificing liquidity. Each _USDai_ token is backed by a portfolio of GPU financing deals and a reserve of treasury bills or other liquid assets. When one dollar enters GAIB’s protocol or when the portfolio generates a dollar in yield, one _USDai_ is minted; conversely, when a dollar of yield is paid out, one _USDai_ is burned. This ensures _USDai_’s market capitalization mirrors its underlying assets' value.

## **An Avenue for Yield Generation**

Although _USDai_ itself is not yield-bearing, investors can stake it to earn returns. For each _USDai_ staked, investors receive one _**sUSDai**_, a liquid receipt token denoting their share of the staked position. As the portfolio generates income, _sUSDai_ accrues the corresponding yield.

## **A Base Currency for the AI Era**

Beyond simply representing an investor’s share in the portfolio, _USDai_ is poised to become a foundational currency in the AI economy. GAIB plans to integrate _USDai_ across various DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, trading, and liquidity provisioning, further enhancing its long-term value beyond native yield generation.
