# How USDai works

USDai is the first **AI Synthetic Dollar** introduced by GAIB, fully backed by GPU financing deals and a small reserve of treasury bills. Its supply adjusts in real-time—when capital enters the protocol or yield is generated, one USDai is minted; when yield is paid out, one USDai is burned, ensuring its market cap reflects the value of the underlying assets.

Whitelisted, KYC-compliant users can mint USDai by depositing USDC, while non-whitelisted users can swap stablecoins for USDai through liquidity pools. Once acquired, USDai can be staked to earn **sUSDai**, a token that accrues yield as the protocol collects real world yields. USDai can also be traded, used for lending or borrowing, or provided as liquidity in AMM pools for additional returns.

When staked, USDai is exchanged for **sUSDai**, and its value increases over time based on the protocol’s rewards. Users can unstake after a 14-day cooldown period and receive their original stake plus accrued rewards.

In addition to staking, **sUSDai** can be used for trading in AMM pools, liquidity provisioning, or creating Principal and Yield Tokens (PT/YT) for customizable risk-return strategies.

In terms of exiting USDai, whitelisted users can redeem USDai for USDC at a 1:1 ratio, while non-whitelisted users can swap it for stablecoins via liquidity pools, expanding accessibility.

Overall, USDai bridges compute with on-chain assets, offering users a seamless way to earn yield, manage risk, and create strategies based on their own risk-reward preferences.&#x20;
