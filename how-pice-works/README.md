# How PICE works

PICE is the first **AI Synthetic Dollar** introduced by GAIB, fully backed by GPU financing deals and a small reserve of treasury bills. Its supply adjusts in real-time—when capital enters the protocol or yield is generated, one PICE is minted; when yield is paid out, one PICE is burned, ensuring its market cap reflects the value of the underlying assets.

Whitelisted, KYC-compliant users can mint PICE by depositing USDC, while non-whitelisted users can swap stablecoins for PICE through liquidity pools. Once acquired, PICE can be staked to earn **sPICE**, a token that accrues yield as the protocol collects real world yields. PICE can also be traded, used for lending or borrowing, or provided as liquidity in AMM pools for additional returns.

When staked, PICE is exchanged for **sPICE**, and its value increases over time based on the protocol’s rewards. Users can unstake after a 14-day cooldown period and receive their original stake plus accrued rewards.

In addition to staking, **sPICE** can be used for trading in AMM pools, liquidity provisioning, or creating Principal and Yield Tokens (PT/YT) for customizable risk-return strategies.

In terms of exiting PICE, whitelisted users can redeem PICE for USDC at a 1:1 ratio, while non-whitelisted users can swap it for stablecoins via liquidity pools, expanding accessibility.

Overall, PICE bridges compute with on-chain assets, offering users a seamless way to earn yield, manage risk, and create strategies based on their own risk-reward preferences.&#x20;
