# How to Dispose of USDai

## **Redeeming**

Whitelisted, KYC-compliant users can redeem _USDai_ directly through the GAIB protocol. By depositing _USDai_, they receive stablecoins at a 1:1 ratio, offering a straightforward exit option for verified participants.

## **Swapping**

Non-whitelisted users can exchange _USDai_ for stablecoins by using the GAIB user interface to access external liquidity pools. This approach enables broader participation, without direct redemption privileges.
