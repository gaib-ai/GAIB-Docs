# How to Dispose of USDai

## **Redeeming**

Whitelisted, KYC-compliant users can redeem USDai directly through the GAIB protocol. By depositing USDai, they receive USDC at a 1:1 ratio, offering a straightforward exit option for verified participants.

## **Swapping**

Non-whitelisted users can exchange USDai for stablecoins by using the GAIB user interface to access external liquidity pools. This approach enables broader participation, without direct redemption privileges.
