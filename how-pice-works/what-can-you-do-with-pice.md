# What Can You Do with USDai

## **Staking**

Users can stake USDai to receive **sUSDai**, a liquid, yield-bearing token representing their staked positions. Yield accrues via a floating exchange rate between sUSDai and USDai, allowing stakers to benefit from the growth in the underlying asset.

## **Lending and Borrowing**

GAIB will integrate with major lending protocols to let users deposit USDai into lending pools and earn additional returns. Borrowing will also be possible, enabling users to lock major cryptocurrencies as collateral and borrow USDai against them.

## **Trading**

A variety of trading pairs will be introduced, pairing USDai with other major currencies. By positioning USDai as a base currency, GAIB ensures seamless swaps and easy management of trading positions.

## **Liquidity Provisioning**

GAIB incentivizes users to supply USDai liquidity in AMM pools. Liquidity providers earn fees and receive GAIB token incentives, making this an attractive way to support the ecosystem and generate income.
