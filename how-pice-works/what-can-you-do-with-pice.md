# What Can You Do with PICE

## **Staking**

Users can stake PICE to receive **sPICE**, a liquid, yield-bearing token representing their staked positions. Yield accrues via a floating exchange rate between sPICE and PICE, allowing stakers to benefit from the growth in the underlying asset.

## **Lending and Borrowing**

GAIB will integrate with major lending protocols to let users deposit PICE into lending pools and earn additional returns. Borrowing will also be possible, enabling users to lock major cryptocurrencies as collateral and borrow PICE against them.

## **Trading**

A variety of trading pairs will be introduced, pairing PICE with other major currencies. By positioning PICE as a base currency, GAIB ensures seamless swaps and easy management of trading positions.

## **Liquidity Provisioning**

GAIB incentivizes users to supply PICE liquidity in AMM pools. Liquidity providers earn fees and receive GAIB token incentives, making this an attractive way to support the ecosystem and generate income.
