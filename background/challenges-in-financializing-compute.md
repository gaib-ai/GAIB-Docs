# Challenges in Financializing Compute

Just as gold once served as the backbone of monetary systems, we at GAIB believe that GPU compute power could become the foundation for a new digital economy in the AI era. However, unlike gold, GPUs are not easily divisible or tradable in their physical form, especially when it comes to the enterprise-grade hardware that GAIB focuses on.\


We draw parallels between tokenizing compute resources and gold to highlight a fundamental challenge in the high-performance computing market:

> Enterprise-grade GPUs represent the pinnacle of computing power, but their physical nature creates significant barriers to widespread accessibility and tradability.

Consider a single [NVIDIA H100 GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/) card. This powerful piece of hardware comes with a hefty price tag of \~US$30,000. However, these GPUs are rarely used in isolation. They're typically deployed in clusters or systems, such as [NVIDIA's DGX H100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/data-center/dgx-h100/), which houses eight H100 GPUs in a single machine. Such a system can easily cost over \~$300,000. This high unit cost alone creates a substantial barrier to entry for many potential investors or users, let alone missing the investment instruments and channels.



Furthermore, **GPUs lack the fungibility** that makes gold so easily tradable.&#x20;

Unlike gold, which can be divided into smaller units without losing its intrinsic properties, a GPU cannot be split. You cannot take an H100 GPU and break it into smaller, functioning parts. This indivisibility is a crucial difference.

* In the world of precious metals, one ounce of pure gold is essentially interchangeable with another ounce of the same purity.&#x20;
* GPUs, on the other hand, can have subtle variations in performance due to manufacturing processes.&#x20;

Their value also varies based on factors like age, usage history, and specific model variations. This non-fungibility complicates the process of valuation and exchange.

Operational complexity presents another significant challenge. Gold can be stored with minimal ongoing costs, whereas GPUs require constant maintenance, regular software updates, and operational support to retain their value and functionality. This adds layers of complexity to owning and trading these assets that do not exist with precious metals.

Finally, the value of a GPU is primarily derived from its computational capabilities. When a GPU is idle, it is essentially a depreciating asset—consuming electricity and requiring maintenance without generating value. This is in stark contrast to gold, which retains its value even when stored unused in a vault, often serving as an inflation hedge.



GAIB’s approach to tokenization seeks to overcome these challenges by creating a digital representation of GPU compute assets that can be easily divided, traded, and utilized. By tokenizing GPU clusters and their yields, rather than individual units, and enabling fractional ownership through NFTs, GAIB makes these valuable computing resources more accessible and liquid.
