# Background

This missing Economic Layer has inspired GAIB to validate the idea that as AI technologies advance, the demand for powerful compute resources, especially enterprise-grade high-end GPUs, is skyrocketing.

GAIB financializes and provides liquidity for the on-chain AI economy

* The foundational idea of tokenizing on-chain compute stems from the observation that in the AI era, compute power is becoming akin to a form of currency.
* The financialization of tokenized on-chain compute draws parallels with how commodity markets evolved. For instance, just as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) allowed for more liquid and accessible investment in property markets or gold ETF (and other products) allowed for more direct and accessible ways to get gold exposure, GAIB creates a similar model for high-performance computing resources.
