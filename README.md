# Introduction

GAIB (/ga-yeeb/) is the **first AI Economic Layer**, creating a new type of yield bearing assets backed by real AI demands. It tokenizes enterprise-grade GPUs and their yields, creating a decentralized liquid market for compute assets, addressing the growing demand for high-performance computing while giving investors direct exposure to GPU assets. The platform supports a range of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, including GPU-backed synthetic dollars, lending and borrowing, options and futures, and other derivatives.

The name GAIB is inspired not only by the movie Dune, which means “the unseen or the future”, but also by the three things we focus on: GPU, AI & Blockchain.&#x20;

Compute is the new currency and GPUs are a new asset class in the AI era, akin to spice in Dune, GAIB is liberating a trillion-dollar AI & compute market.
