# AID Alpha

## AID Alpha

Starting May 12th, 2025, GAIB will launch AID Alpha, the Alpha version of AID, to give community early access to AI yield, together with a range of rewards, benefits, and gamifications for the early birds.

### What is AID Alpha?

AID Alpha functions as an early deposit program for GAIB's AID, the first synthetic dollar backed by AI compute assets, to bootstrap liquidity for the GAIB protocol while rewarding early birds with juicy yields and other benefits.

### How Does AID Alpha Work?

#### Chains

AID Alpha will be available on a range of chains, including Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum, Base, BNB, Story Protocol, and Plume. Please note that the support for different chains may not go live at the same time. Stay tuned with GAIB's [X](https://x.com/gaib_ai), [Telegram](https://t.me/gaib_ai), and [Discord](https://discord.gg/gaibofficial) for chain updates.

#### Accepted Assets

AID Alpha supports USDC and USDT as deposits initially, and will expand the support for other stablecoins / synthetic dollars over the span of the program. Stay tuned with GAIB's [X](https://x.com/gaib_ai) for asset support updates.

#### User Journey & Fund Flow

The AID Alpha smart contracts follow ERC-4626 standards. For every dollar of stablecoin / synthetic dollar that a user deposits, a receipt token will be minted representing the deposit of the particular asset on the particular chain. For example:

* Alice deposits 100 USDC on Ethereum, and she will receive 100 AIDa.USDC on Ethereum.
* Bob deposits 1000 USDT on Arbitrum, and he will receive 1000 AIDa.USDT on Arbitrum.

GAIB will deploy all of the AID Alpha deposits in US Treasury Bills initially, and gradually allocate the capital to early GPU financing deals on the platform.

#### Yields

Users will earn yields in Spices, GAIB's points rewards leading to benefits upon GAIB token launch. 1 AIDa accrues 1 Spice per day. Multipliers apply to early depositors and other user activities.

#### Duration

The campaign is expected to last less than three months, with earlier supporters getting higher rewards.

#### Referral

Those who refer other users through the referral link will earn 20% of their referred users' Spice and 10% of their second-order referrals.
