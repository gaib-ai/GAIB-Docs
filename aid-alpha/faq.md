# FAQ

1. **What is AID?**\
   AID is an AI synthetic dollar launched by GAIB, bridging AI economies with DeFi to offer sustainable yields from AI compute demand. More information about AID can be found [here](https://gaibofficial.medium.com/introducing-aid-the-ai-dollar-fd5e59fab1ce).
2. **What is AID Alpha?**\
   AID Alpha is the initial launch phase of GAIB’s AI synthetic dollar, AID. It allows early users to deposit stablecoins like USDT and USDC into GAIB vaults across supported chains (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, etc.) ahead of the full AID mainnet release. During the campaign, users receive AID Alpha tokens—temporary receipt tokens representing their deposits—which will later be redeemable 1:1 for mainnet AID tokens. While funds are locked, they generate real-world yield through a mix of T-bills and GPU financing deals.
3. **Is AID a stablecoin?**\
   Unlike fiat or treasury bills backed stablecoins, AID is a synthetic dollar backed by a basket of GPU financing deals, including GPU-backed debt and GPU cash flows. It serves as a unit of account of the underlying GPU asset portfolio that GAIB manages, to give users easy & instant access to GPU as an asset class without sacrificing liquidity, and composability with other DeFi legos (e.g. lending, yield trading) to offer more use cases for all risk & profiles.
4. **What’s the risk profile of the assets backing AID — how volatile or secure are they?**\
   AID is backed by a basket of GPU financing deals. These could be loan agreements with enterprise-grade GPUs as the collateral, rights to  GPUs’ revenue share, or a mix of both. Overcollateralization and bankruptcy-remote structure apply. Insurance funds will be set up to protect users against any protocol losses.
5. **Is AID's backing audited or verified?**\
   GAIB works with third-party auditors, credit underwriters, custody, attestation, and other professional service providers when necessary to maximize investor protection and risk-reward for each GPU financing deal.
6. **Will AID be bridged or natively minted on the supported chains?**\
   AID will be natively minted on the supported chains. Cross-chain liquidity pools will eventually be set up, but during the AID alpha phase, tokens will be exclusively native to each chain.
7. **Which tokens can I deposit during the Alpha launch?**\
   You can deposit USDT and USDC and other accepted stablecoins.
8. **What benefits do early depositors receive?**\
   Early depositors will earn Spices, which are GAIB points backed by GPU yields, potential Spice multipliers, as well as opportunities to be whitelisted for GAIB's upcoming NFTs. Referrers will also earn referral rewards.
9. **How are reward points calculated?**\
   Users will earn 1 base Spice per dollar per day after depositing until the program finishes. On top of that, different multipliers apply to different seasons. More details will be announced on GAIB's X and Medium.
10. **What are point multipliers?**\
    Special incentives increase earned points for early depositors, exclusive partners, and active community members.
11. **Can I benefit from referring to other users?**\
    Yes, you receive benefits from the points your referrals earn, extending up to second-order referrals.
12. **What happens if the deposit cap is hit — do new users get excluded?**\
    New caps will be released and shared with sufficient time. Stay close to Gaib's official channels and you won't be excluded.
13. **What benefits do NFTs unlock — are they cosmetic, access-based, or yield-based?**\
    NFTs will lead to special and exclusive rewards at GAIB’s token launch.
14. **Is there a snapshot for Fremen Essence NFT eligibility or is it real-time?**\
    Eligibility to be whitelisted for the NFT will be possible until the end of the campaign or whenever it is minted towards its end, which will be notified with sufficient time.
15. **When will the GAIB token launch and when is the Spice snapshot?**\
    The GAIB token is expected to launch in 2025. The Spice snapshot will be taken at the end of the AID Alpha campaign. Follow Gaib's official channels for the latest updates on these milestones.&#x20;
16. **Are the vaults audited? Who built the contracts?**\
    Smart contracts were built by GAIB engineering team and audited by Sherlock. The audit report can be found [here](https://docs.gaib.ai/audits).
17. **Where are the deposited stablecoins held, and is custody decentralized?**\
    Deposits are being held in smart contracts and custody solutions, if necessary, before being deployed in GPU financing deals and treasury bills.
18. **What is the penalty percentage for early withdrawal and how is it calculated?**\
    The funds deposited into the AID alpha campaign will not be withdrawable during the campaign; therefore, no penalty can be incurred.
19. **Where can I stay updated about the AID Alpha launch?**\
    Updates are shared via[ X](https://x.com/gaib_ai),[ Telegram](https://t.me/+rekW5KBJC3VmNDJl), and[ Discord](https://discord.gg/gaibofficial).
