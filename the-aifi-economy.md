# The AiFi Economy

GAIB is building the AiFi economy, which signifies a paradigm shift in how we perceive and utilize computational resources, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As AI continues to transform industries and drive innovation, compute power, especially that provided by high-performance GPUs, is becoming an increasingly critical resource - akin to a new currency in this evolving economic landscape.



Currently, the decentralized compute tech stack consists of several well-developed layers:&#x20;

* Hardware layer: GPU manufacturers
* Network layer: Decentralized compute networks
* Service layer: Middleware service providers and aggregators&#x20;
* Consumer layer: End-users and AI companies&#x20;

Yet, the full potential of this AI economy has yet to be realized due to a crucial missing component: an economic layer. GAIB bridges the gap between physical computing resources and financial markets, enabling the transformation of GPU compute power into a tradable, financialized asset class.
